# How to contribute 🧐

There are 4 ways to contribute to project: solving an issue, improving docummentation, opening an issue or fixing a bug not mapped yet.

## Before contributing, pay attention to some rules:

1. Don't forget to comment your code.
2. By standard, you must name python packages with lowercase letters and avoid to use underline. Take as example the package named as `sprites`.
3. On the other hand, files are named with lowercase letters and, if necessary, you can use underline. Example: `hello_world.py`.
4. Finally, functions and classes are named with lowercase letters and, if necessary, you can use underline for functions and the CapWords pattern for classes. Function example: `function_name`. Class example: `MyClass`.

> For more information about the language standards, you should read the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
